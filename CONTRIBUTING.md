# Contributing to [Twister](https://github.com/criccomini/twister/blob/main/README.md)

Twister is open source software. We welcome feedback and aim to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Submitting Code Changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue your pull request and wait for it to be reviewed by a maintainer or contributor!

## Report Bugs Using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/criccomini/twister/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)
- References (e.g. documentation pages related to the issue)
